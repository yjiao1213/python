LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, the company operates an online lending platform that enables borrowers to obtain a loan, and investors to purchase notes backed by payments made on loans. <br>
The goal of our analysis is to use other data (mostly numerical) to create an empirical prediction as to how likely a borrower is to repay his/her loan on time. <br>
We got the data from: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club <br>
