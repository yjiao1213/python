# Assignment 2

## Gibbs Sampling

Use Gibbs sampling algortithm to calculate the probability distribution.
This part adopts Python 3.x as the programming language.

### Input Format (Should be strictly obeyed)
gibbs price schools=good location=ugly -u 10000 -d 0

### Output

1. Result of the Probability
2. The Graph 
### Other Information
This program read the excel file given by the course instructor. 
The excel file should be put within the same folder with the Python file.

### Package
xlread/matlibplot

## Kalman Filter
Use Kalman filter to predict the GDP.

### Environment 
The programming language adopts Matlab. The script can be running in recent Matlab (over Matlab 2012).

### Input & Output
1. Input: 2 or 3 for both matlab files. (Representing the 2-sensor model and the 3-sensor model)
2. Ouput is 3 images and related coefficients. 
3. kalman_whole.m is the full version of the Kalman filter implementation.
4. kalman_transition_only.m is the version for Transition model
